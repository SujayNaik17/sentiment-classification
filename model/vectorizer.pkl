# Text vectorizer for feature extraction
# This file contains the fitted vectorizer (TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer, etc.)
# used to transform text data into numerical features for the ML model.
#
# Common vectorizers include:
# - TF-IDF Vectorizer
# - Count Vectorizer
# - Word2Vec embeddings
# - FastText embeddings
# - Pre-trained language model embeddings
#
# To be generated by the training notebook (2_training.ipynb)
